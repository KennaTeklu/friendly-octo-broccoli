 * P4 BODYWEIGHT LIBRARY — full 11-component coverage for gym-free training.

 *

 * Every exercise declares:

 *   bodyweight: true

 *   fitnessComponents: [...]       — which of the 11 it trains

 *   strengthIndex: 0.0-1.2         — fraction of bodyweight moved (for 1RM math)

 *   progressionChain / progressionLevel — for rung tracking

 *

 * The generator merges this library when user.settings.trainingMode is

 * 'bodyweight' or 'mixed'. The gym library is never touched.
